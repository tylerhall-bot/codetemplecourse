README - Module 1 HTML Assignment

This is a Knowledge Check on HTML concepts.

First, I created a contact form that includes:
- A text input for the user's name
- An email input for the user's email address
- A textarea for the message
- A submit button
- (Bonus) A radio button group asking how the user found the site

Next, I created a table listing my 3 favorite fruits with made-up prices and random quantities.

I then created a navigation bar that includes Home, About, and Contact links. I used "#" as a placeholder for the links and added a comment in the code noting that I wasnâ€™t sure if actual URLs were required. This navigation bar was inserted immediately after the opening <body> tag.

Finally, I added two images using a placeholder image URL. One image was left as-is, and the other had rounded corners applied using the inline style attribute border-radius. I had to reference the lesson material again to remember the correct syntax for rounded edges.
